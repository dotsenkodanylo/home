# NextJS Home Server Landing Page/App

This application is the landing page for my personal home server. Currently it repressents a sort of temporal *proxy* if you will, for future applications, features, and documentation. 

Till then, all updates will be flowing in with minimal documentation/release notes, mostly in the form of squashed commits, until proper git release strategy is developed; woo!
